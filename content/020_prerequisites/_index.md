# Getting Started

To start the workshop, first get access to the account that has been provisioned for you for this AWS event:

[**Access the AWS account**](/020_prerequisites/portal/)

Once you have completed with either setup, continue with [**Create a Workspace**](/020_prerequisites/workspace/)
